# solqc

This repository consists of the Python code used in my Master's thesis. An example of an average year calculation is done in example_run.py. Raw data can be retrieved from lmt.bioforsk.no. Remember that the column for global solar irradiation is named 'qo' in my code. I can provide my clear sky and extraterrestrial solar irradiation simulations if needed.

To run it:

1. Download or git clone this repository
2. Run the example_run.py file in that directory

The code is now updated to work for Python 3 and pandas 0.18.1.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
